    <!-- css recipe: selector:{property:value} -->
    <!-- selector: what to change, property: what to change about chosen elements, value: what to change property to -->
    <!-- basic style properties: background-color, border, font-weight, CHECK FOR MORE SLIDE CHANGED -->
    <!-- linking css files: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/mysite.css" -->
    <!-- selectors: p: all paragraph elements, p#red: the paragraph with the id 'red', p.red: all paragraphs with the class 'red' -->
    <!-- if we leave off the p from p.callout, then all elements with the class 'callout' will be selected, not just paragraph 'callouts' -->
    <!-- spaces denotes inside: ex: div.callout p will select paragraphs inside divs that are class callout -->
    <!-- order matters but so does specificity: p.special red then p black will make p.special red because p.special is more specific than p -->
    <!-- nested tags inherit: div.sam green then span underline will make any span inside div class sam green along with underlined -->
    <!-- tag names, ids, class names, and a combo of them can be used to select -->
    <!-- fun trivia: # was once called an octathorpe -->
    <!-- comma: more than one selected: ex: aside, #sidebar selects all asides and the thing with id sidebar -->
    <!-- >: immediate child: ex: aside>p selects all paragraphs directly inside aside, but does not select a paragraph in a div in an aside -->
    <!-- p:hover will do a thing when you hover, there's tons of pseudo classes (hover, focus, first-child, not) -->
    <!-- remember w3schools and your partner are helpful for you, don't ask last minute! -->
