    <!-- block and inline layout -->
    <!-- by default, all elements are either block or inline elements -->
    <!-- block stretches across the whole page and fall one after another, as if you pressed enter after each "paragraph" (element) -->
    <!-- inline elements fall 'in line', like how letters in a row of text are in the same line -->
    <!-- div: generally used as a container for other elements, block level -->
    <!-- header, nav, section, article, aside, footer, details, summary: a few block elements -->

    <!-- id and class -->
    <!-- when styling with css, id and class lets us apply styles to parts -->
    <!-- id vs class -->
    <!-- id is 'i am unique on this page, only i have this id', if there's multiple with the same id, ignores the others -->
    <!-- class is 'there are many of me, make us all this way' -->
    <!-- neither do anything until we use a css file to style them -->
    <!-- things can have multiple classes -->
    <!-- id is kinda dumb, just class but it can only be applied once -->

    <!-- html forms -->
    <!-- get and post -->
    <!-- get method: the data itself is in the url, which can be bookmarked and shared -->
    <!-- post method: passes data in the body, can send more data and can send more securely -->
    <!-- form inputs: input, select, textarea -->
    <!-- <input name="..." type="..."> name is how you refer to the data, has different types -->
    <!-- text, password, submit, checckbox, radio -->
    <!-- radio: can only select one of the same name -->
    <!-- w3schools exists, remember to look at it for formatting -->
    <!-- <select name="language">
        <option value="" disabled selected>PleaseSelect</option>
    <select> -->
    <!-- <label><input><input></label> lets you click the text instead of just the button -->

    <!-- putting a form together -->
    <!-- w3schools (&/or google), classmates, instructor: good resources -->
    <!-- teacher uses these constantly, you don't have to remember everything in your head -->
    <!-- remember it exists, then pull reference -->
